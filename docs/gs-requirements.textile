Architecturally, Onering is separated into two distinct areas of concern: the server and the client(s).  The server is responsible for the Onering REST API, the web frontend, and backend data processing and storage.  The client is a Ruby library and general-purpose command line utility that wraps the REST API to provide a clean way to work with Onering's data, as well as a framework for extracting pieces of data about the local system for insertion into Onering.

Let's start with the server.  Here is an overview of some of the core technologies it uses:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
{% for item in page.server %}
  <dt>{{ item[0]}}</dt>
  <dd>{{ item[1] | join:', ' }}</dd>
{% endfor %}
</dl>


h4. Installing the Required Software

These are streamlined, relatively-straightforward instructions for getting a _basic_ environment setup that can run Onering.  If you intend to run Onering in production at any kind of scale, you should consult the <a>Advanced Topics</a> section for more details.
